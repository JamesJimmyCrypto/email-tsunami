# NOTES

I know that many people faced a common problem that is due to the aount of users, since at the beginning there was less users, less load on the server, and more google accounts available.

Since we got more users, the bombing per email ID ratio raised enough to trigger google who disable many of the gmail accounts used by the bomber.

Because of that, google doesn't let me create email accounts without a phone number, otherwise they would be either banned (as long as all the accounts associated) or disabled.

There is also the SMTP limit set by gmail (500 emails a day) beyond which the emails are not sent and google starts considering the account as fraudulent.

If you want to support the project, please join us on DISCORD or TELEGRAM and donate me GMAIL IDS in DMs with PASSWORDS.
